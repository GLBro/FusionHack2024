### Our Topics 
We decided to fuse:
- Finance
  - Specifically Stocks and trading
- Education
- Game

### What is it?
It is a trading game, that uses fake money and resources. 
It allows the user to buy and sell stocks in the four areas we have created (Stone, Wood, Food, Cloth). 
When stocks are bought and sold the price increases/decreases respectively. 


### What it is made for 
As trading is a difficult and tricky area to enter as a young adult; It is made for education purposes to teach young people the basics of trading, so they go in less blind than we have.
